# Students-Datas-Manager

A small homework for my programming class.

------------------- Students Datas Manager -------------------

The output shows a menu on the console.

1)
The user can add students datas such as:
- the last name

- the number of marks they want with their coefficients
- the birth date

2)
Option to see the list of registered students in local or the full list (thanks to a .txt file).

3)
Erase a student from the files and the student tab.

4)
Research a student by his last name, or his first name, or his birth date (either by day or month or year).

5)
Check the students tab information.

6)
Quit the app.
